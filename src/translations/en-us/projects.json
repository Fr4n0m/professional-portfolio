We worked from the concept to the implementation, creating both the back-end and front-end. In addition to various technologies, we implemented integrations like JWT for user account control and login, a dashboard to manage all the data, and features like logging in with different social networks, account creation as a user to purchase products or as a company to add them, maps showing the nearest locations where products could be found, among other things. Due to confidentiality reasons, the code is not displayed.",
